At 9:48 PM, October 5th, 2014:

The player checks 1000 potential shuffled moves to 1 depth. Scores moves
based on her score minus the opponent's score. Wins against dumb player nearly
every single time (once lost on a 12 d game randomly. Suspect it is because of
the sampling of 1000 random moves from the potential list). When playing
itself, our players seem to score relatively easily regardless of pairs.

October 7th, 2014:

results with capture-focused, their-move-weighted (1.5x) player against last submission player, (3,9) vs (4,8), math.pow down to 1.1

658, 256 with control of size 50
750, 186 with control of size 10
626, 320 with control of size 250 (aka not preferencing captures)
536, 424 with control of size 8
more or less the same with size 10
622, 310 with control of size 20
590, 372 with same control
642, 294 with control 15, limit 2
624, 322 with same
didn't win by much with control 6
LOST with control 2
600, 356 with control 16, limit 3
666, 280 with control 50, limit 3
610, 326 with control 100, limit 3

final verdict for now: control 100 (feels safe)

next: optimize the 1.5x weight and the 1.1 big number power weight

656, 252 with 2.0 weight
548, 348 with 2.0 weight
622, 322 with 2.0 weight
628, 308 with 1.25 weight
628, 316 with 1.25 weight
672, 288 with 1.25 weight

final verdict: lets go 1.3 weight for now

630, 310 when we don't allow them to steal from us (control 100)
656, 278 when we don't allow them to steal from us (control 100)
588, 352 when we don't allow them to steal from us (control 100)
